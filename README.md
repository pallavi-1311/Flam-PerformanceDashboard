
#  Performance-Critical Data Visualization Dashboard

A high-performance **real-time data visualization dashboard** built using **Next.js 14 (App Router) + TypeScript**.  
It can smoothly render and update **10,000+ data points at 60 FPS**, optimized for **low-latency streaming**, **interactive charts**, and **efficient resource usage**.

---

##  Features

###  Core Functionalities
- **Multiple Chart Types:** Line, Bar, Scatter, and Heatmap  
- **Real-time Updates:** New data points generated every 100ms  
- **Interactive Controls:** Zoom, Pan, Data Filtering, and Time Range Selection  
- **Data Aggregation:** Group by `1min`, `5min`, `1hour`  
- **Virtual Scrolling:** Efficient rendering for large data tables  
- **Responsive Design:** Optimized for desktop, tablet, and mobile  

###  Performance Targets
- 60 FPS rendering even with 10,000+ points  
- <100ms user interaction latency  
- Stable memory usage with continuous streaming  
- Efficient use of `Web Workers` for data generation

##  Setup & Installation

### 1) Clone the project

git clone https://github.com/your-username/performance-dashboard.git
cd performance-dashboard
### 2)Install dependencies
npm install
### 30 Run the development server
npm run dev


➡ Open http://localhost:3000/dashboard

### 4) Build for production
npm run build
npm start

##  Performance Testing InstructionsClone the project

### Run the app using npm run dev.

Open it in Google Chrome.

Go to DevTools → Performance Tab → Record.

Interact with the dashboard or enable “Stress Mode” from the control panel.

Observe the FPS (frames per second) and memory usage for 30–60 seconds.

## Expected Results:

1) Maintain ~60 FPS during real-time updates

2) Memory usage below 250 MB during extended runs
---

## Advanced Next.js Features Implemented

1) Streaming UI with Suspense boundaries

2) Server Actions for data updates

3) Edge Middleware for caching and route optimization

4) Static Generation for chart configuration

5) Route Handlers under /api/data/

 6) Web Workers for async data processing

### Optimization Techniques

useMemo & useCallback to prevent re-renders

React.memo for heavy components (charts)

Efficient requestAnimationFrame loop for Canvas rendering

useTransition for smooth state updates

Time-series data aggregation to reduce render load

### Future Enhancements

Add dark/light theme support

Enable persistent caching with Service Workers

Integrate WebSocket streaming for live IoT data

Add testing with Jest and React Testing Library
